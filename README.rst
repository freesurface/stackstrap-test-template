Template README
===============
This is the README file for your template. It should describe what stack your
template provides and give an overview of the features of the template.

This file will not end up in projects that are created from your template, see
the PROJECT-README file to setup any default information you think that users
of your template should be including in their projects. For example, if you
should any Fabric_ or Capistrano_ tasks with your project then the project
specific README file should document those tasks.

The swapping of the README files is done through entries in the stackstrap.yml
file.
